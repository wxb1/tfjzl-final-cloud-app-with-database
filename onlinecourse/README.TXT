For some reason Pillow would not install so I installed it manually

Tried to install pillow from a whl package here:
https://pypi.org/project/pillow/10.0.0/#files

But that didn't work.

For some reason Pillow would not install so I installed it manually. That means from command line not instead of requirement.txt
